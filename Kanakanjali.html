<b> Robotics provides an exciting way to Learn how the real world interacts with technology. 
</b> <u> When you build a robot, you understand Sensors, motion and decision-making in a practical way. 
</u> <i> you can also explore how Physical Al help machines respond intelligently to their environment.
</i> <b> Learning step-by-step makes robotics Simble. </b> 

<br><br>


<font color="Red" size 12 face="Verdana"> Robotics also improves problem-solving skills, when a robot doesn't work 
the way you expect, you learn to think Logically, fix errors, and try new ideas. This process makes you more Creative and helps 
you understand how hardware and software work together.
<i><b><u> In the future, robotics and Physical APD will be a major part of many jobs. </i></b></u> </font>
